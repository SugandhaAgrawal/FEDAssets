# FEDAssets
Links to FED stuff all round

I am going to add various sub directories to define specific framework, library, tooling etc.. and each will contain presentations, pdfs, 
a text file holding the important links to the same.

This is intended to get rid of all bookmarks and keep all information consolidated together :)
